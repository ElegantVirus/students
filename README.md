- I wrongly believed I was doing the task for a different company.<br/>
- I didn't get the task in time (though delay wasn't that big)<br/>
- Recruiter leaked the data of another candidate when sending me an email. <br/>
The recruiter was the least competent person I have ever worked with, please make conclusions
